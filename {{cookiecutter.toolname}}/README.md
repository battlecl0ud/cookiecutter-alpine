### Tweaking 🔧

Generated files might require some tweaking to work. Common tweaks include:

* Correcting ports
* Dockerhub image source
* Project information
* Alpine packages
* Environment variables
* Tool dependent setup
  - We suggest doing those in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script

### Port mapping 🔀
In the Portainer interface, make sure you map you desired ports accordingly in `Advanced Options`.

### Loot 💰
A `/loot` volume is created when the image is run, you can use it like so to keep generated data:  

```bash
$ nmap example.com > /loot/nmap_results.txt

```
